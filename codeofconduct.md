## Inclusion

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

All people are expected to treat others with respect and consideration.

If we believe that you are not complying with this Code of Conduct, the matter will be carefully reviewed and the appropriate action will be taken.

## No Sales Pitches

FinOps Foundation is about sharing industry best practices, identifying the challenges that cloud poses and solutions that address them. While your products, tooling and business offerings may assist in solving some of these challenges we do not condone sales pitches. Unless there is a specific request about a product you are involved with, you should not continue to interject your offerings into conversation.

## Defamation

Adding negative comments or viewpoints to the conversation about your competitor's offerings will also not be accepted. We would like to keep the conversation positive and on point.

If you witness or are subjected to inappropriate behavior, or have concerns related to this Code of Conduct, please promptly contact board@finops.org.
